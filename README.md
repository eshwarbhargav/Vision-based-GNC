# Vision-based-GNC
The Vision-based-GNC projects focused on Guidance, Navigation, and Control (GNC) systems that leverage advanced computer vision and AI techniques. The projects demonstrate how image-based inputs (such as optical payload data) are integrated with traditional GNC algorithms to enhance navigation, tracking, and control capabilities.
