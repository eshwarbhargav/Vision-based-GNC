## Introduction

Guidance, Navigation, and Control (GNC) systems play a vital role in the operation of aerospace vehicles, robotics, and autonomous systems. This repository focuses on projects that integrate computer vision and machine learning techniques into traditional GNC frameworks. By leveraging visual data from cameras and other sensors, these projects enhance navigation accuracy, safety and environmental awareness, and system autonomy. Each project includes detailed documentation, code, and examples, providing insights into the use of vision-based inputs in GNC systems.

## Projects

At the moment this project's list is empty! Will update the file once they are ready.
